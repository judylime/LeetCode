// Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum.

// <!-- 1.Can I restate the problem in my own words? -->
//   "implement addition"
// <!-- 2.what are the inputs that go into the problem? -->
//   -ints?
//   -floats?
//   -what about string for large numbers?
// <!-- 3. what are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem? -->
//   - int? float? string?
// 4.Can the outputs be detemined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
//  Yes
// 5.How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
